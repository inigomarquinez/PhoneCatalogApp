The new Galaxy Note 9 has much the same hardware and cameras as the Galaxy S9 Plus. The main thing that sets the Galaxy Note 9 apart is its S Pen, which now has added Bluetooth connectivity and can be used as a single-button Bluetooth remote control. Samsung's Experience UI is highly customised but feels smooth and natural to use, with several thoughtful ways to use the S Pen. This phone is a bit too large and heavy, but it has a huge 6.4-inch screen with curved edges and a 4000mAh battery that could last you up to two days. The cameras are great, and Samsung's app gives you a lot to play with. If you want to spend this much money and can live with the bulk, the Galaxy Note 9 delivers a top-class experience.
