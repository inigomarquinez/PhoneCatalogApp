The Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) is built using aluminium and glass which makes it feel very premium. However, given its 5.7-inch display size, the phone feels bulky and heavy. It doesn’t have the best ergonomics either. The Super Amoled display produces good colours and brightness although we weren’t to pleased with the tone of the whites. The fingerprint sensor works well and buttons have good feedback. The Exynos 7880 provides decent power for the UI and most apps although heavy games don’t always run smoothly. The 16-megapixel rear sensor has slow focus and lacks good detail in landscapes and macros. It lacks 4K video recording too. Battery life is good as we managed to go beyond a day of regular use.
